# Woodpecker
A simple command line folder renaming tool for Plex.

# Usage

Download the `.jar` file from the repo right here, or if you're a geek, you can build the latest codebase via the command `gradle clean build`. No points for guessing, you're going to need [gradle](https://gradle.org/).

## Plex Mode

Once you have your directories in a style that resembles `test.directory.1984`, you can run `Woodpecker` in `plexmode` and get those renamed in a style that Plex prefers. For example, `Test Directory (1984)`. Please report any bugs.

Command to run:
```
> java -jar woodpecker-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --plexmode
```

## Future Enhancements

The project is tracked on [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/fqPBCv7F/woodpecker). Please provide feedback, and suggest future enhancements. I have a day job, so, _enhancements_ will come slowly.
